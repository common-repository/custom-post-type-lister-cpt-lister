This plugin allows you to list a custom post type in your posts / pages with one simple shortcode.

== Description ==

Hello there!<br>
This plugin will give you the possibility to list any of your custom post types (even a built in post types) to any of your posts or pages, with one simple shortcode <strong>[cpt_show]</strong>

<strong>What it does ?</strong>
<br>
This plugin makes a WP_Query and gets all posts from the custom post type that you've given to it.

<strong>What are the parameters ?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>
	type - Here you have to tell the plugin from which post type you would like to get your posts.
	Example: type="posts"
	</li>
	<li>
	post_status - This is the type of posts that should be listed.
	Example: post_status="published"
	</li>
	<li>
	order - This is how the results should be ordered ASC / DESC.
	Example: order="ASC"
	</li>
	<li>
	order_by - This tells the plugin by what the results should be ordered.
	Example: order_by="publish_date"
	</li>
	<li>
	posts_per_page - With this you tell the plugin how much posts should be listed on the page.
	Example: posts_per_page="5"
	</li>
	<li>
	titles_as_links - This tells the shortcode if the titles of the listed posts should be links that are pointing to the specific page for every unique post. Possible values are 0 & 1. If the value is set to 0 it will print the title without wrapping it in HTML Link tag (), but if the value is set to 1 it will wrap the post title into HTML Link tag and it will point to the specific post page.
	Example: titles_as_links="1"
	</li>
	<li>
	show_post_content - This tells the shortcode if it should show the post content under their titles. Possible values are 0 & 1. If the value is 0 it won't show the post content under its title, but if the value is set to 1 it will list the post content also.
	Example: show_post_content="0"
	</li>
	<li>
	cptl_title_link_class - This is used to tell the shortcode what class should be added to the Link Wrapper of the post title. By default it is cptl_title_link.
	</li>
	<li>
	cptl_title_class - This tells the shortcode what class should be added to the Title Wrapper of the post title. By default it is cptl_title.
	</li>
	<li>
	cptl_content_class - This is used to tell the shortcode what class should be added to the Content Wrapper of the post content. By default it is cptl_content
	</li>
	<li>
	cptl_content_wrapper - This is used to tell the shortcode how wrap the listed results. It can be <strong>'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h4', 'h6', 'li', 'span', 'div'</strong>
	</li>
</ul>
